                <p>XTL Marine was formed in Feb 2012 with the purpose to serve clients with all types 
of service standards on their boats/ yachts. The core strength of quality service is 
embedded in the level of professionalism of our team. I believe that although a 
team has trade experts, they still have to be physically and mentally fit to take 
up any challenge with a string of fortitude and respect for their work. These
are our four basic values being imparted to our team daily. Therefore, we have
seen a great level of contentment in our clients; whom we call our path towards
success. No doubt success brings in a lot of responsibilities and with more 
responsibilities we grow humble in our team of professionals.</p><br>


                <p>In terms of work, we undertake all kinds of yacht service-related work; let it 
be any carpentry, electrical, electronic, mechanical, painting-interior or bottom, 
air-conditioning, upholstery- interior or exteriors, underwater gear, all kinds of 
pump repairs/ service and motor rewinding. Come test us and let us show what
we are capable of. We are dealing with many international brands and only provide
our clients with the topmost quality service to meet and exceed their expectations.</p><br> 
                        
                        
                <p>As stated by our customers, our capability to systematize and administer large 
in-depth projects along with a great team spirit and a winning attitude is setting
new standards of quality and excellence in the marine industry, As a result, XTL
Marine's motto is we provide, "complete yachting solutions". </p>
